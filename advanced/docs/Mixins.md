# Mixins

Along with traditional Object-oriented hierarchies, another popular way of building up classes from reusable components is to build them by combining simpler partial classes.

This is known as the Mixin pattern.
An example of this pattern is the concept of mixins or traits from languages like Scala.

Mixins provide a form of code reuse that is based on composing behavior. A class can include as many mixins as needed, as opposed to inheritance (which can only inherit from 1 class).
