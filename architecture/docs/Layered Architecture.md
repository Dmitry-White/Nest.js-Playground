# Layered Architecture

`Layered Architecture`, also known as `N-tier Architecture`, is a software design pattern used to organize applications into distinct layers or tiers. Each layer has a specific role, and communication between layers is well-defined and hierarchical.

A typical N-tier architecture consists of the following layers:

- Presentation Layer (or User Interface Layer)
- Application Layer (or Business Logic Layer)
- Domain Layer (or Data Model Layer)
- Data Access Layer (or Persistence Layer)

Some Benefits of an N-tier architecture include:

- `Maintainability`: The separation of concerns in different layers simplifies application maintenance and updates without affecting other parts.
- `Reusability`: The modular nature allows component reuse across multiple projects.
- `Security`: Clearly defined layer communication enhances security by restricting direct access to sensitive data and functionality.
